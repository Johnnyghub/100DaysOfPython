When using google colab, dataset needs to uploaded to files everytime you wanna test out the file, because it is only a temporary storage.

Uploading the data to my own gdrive would stop the code from working on any other account, and uploading the file to a live server and fetching it everytime I run the code would be a waste of resources and time for an educational project.

For convenience, from now on with any google colab project, assume the dataset needs to be added to the files section before running. If using anaconda, the file also needs to be uploaded.

A python source file is also provided, however, it is recommended to use the ipynb version as it displays segments of code with their respective graph. This also applies to all pandas projects henceforth for this course.
