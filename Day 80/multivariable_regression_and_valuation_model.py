# Setup and Context

### Introduction

Welcome to Boston Massachusetts in the 1970s! Imagine you're working for a real estate development company. Your company wants to value any residential project before they start. You are tasked with building a model that can provide a price estimate based on a home's characteristics like:
* The number of rooms
* The distance to employment centres
* How rich or poor the area is
* How many students there are per teacher in local schools etc

<img src=https://i.imgur.com/WfUSSP7.png height=350>

To accomplish your task you will:

1. Analyse and explore the Boston house price data
2. Split your data for training and testing
3. Run a Multivariable Regression
4. Evaluate how your model's coefficients and residuals
5. Use data transformation to improve your model performance
6. Use your model to estimate a property price

"""CHAS shows whether the home is next to the Charles River or not. 0 means it is not, 1 means it is. This kind of feature is also known as a dummy variable. 

The average price of a Boston home in the 1970s was 22.53 or $22,530.

* PRICE: The home price in thousands.
* RM: the average number of rooms per owner unit.
* DIS: the weighted distance to the 5 Boston employment centres i.e., the estimated length of the commute.
* RAD: the index of accessibility to highways.

### Run a Pair Plot

**Challenge**

There might be some relationships in the data that we should know about. Before you run the code, make some predictions:

* What would you expect the relationship to be between pollution (NOX) and the distance to employment (DIS)? 
* What kind of relationship do you expect between the number of rooms (RM) and the home value (PRICE)?
* What about the amount of poverty in an area (LSTAT) and home prices? 

Run a [Seaborn `.pairplot()`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.pairplot.html?highlight=pairplot#seaborn.pairplot) to visualise all the relationships at the same time.

* Split the training and testing data roughly 80/20. 
* To get the same random split every time you run your notebook use `random_state=10`. This helps us get the same results every time and avoid confusion while we're learning.

The next step is to evaluate our regression. How good our regression is depends not only on the r-squared. It also depends on the **residuals** - the difference between the model's predictions ($\hat y_i$) and the true values ($y_i$) inside `y_train`.

In an ideal case, what we want is something close to a normal distribution. A normal distribution has a skewness of 0 and a mean of 0. A skew of 0 means that the distribution is symmetrical - the bell curve is not lopsided or biased to one side. Here's what a normal distribution looks like:
